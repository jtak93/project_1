## Game Description

This is the classic game of checkers (also known as Draughts) with an awesome Breaking Bad theme! Players control pieces on an 8x8 board and try to eliminate the enemy. You can read more about the game at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts.

## Motivation

This is the first project for the General Assembly WDI class and is essentially my very first attempt at a real javascript app. I found coding this game was quite a challenge. The code is not very efficient or bug-proof, but I learned a lot (especially things that should not be done when coding).

## Technologies

This game was written in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Installation

The game is deployed at: https://jtak93.github.io/project_1/

## Coming soon (or never)

The game logic is incapable of multiple jumps and may be implemented in the future.
Game breaking bug of pieces dissappearing when double clicked needs to be fixed.
Emojis, 'cause everyone loves emojis.
